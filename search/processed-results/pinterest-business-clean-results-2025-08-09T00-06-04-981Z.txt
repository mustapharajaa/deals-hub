Pinterest Business does not have a general coupon code system for new users to get discounts on advertising. However, businesses can import discounts from Shopify and apply them to Pinterest ads. Additionally, Pinterest may offer credits or promotions, which can be viewed and managed under the Billing section of the Pinterest Business account. 
Methods for Discounts and Promotions:
Importing Shopify Discounts:
If you use Shopify, you can sync your discounts to Pinterest. 
Pinterest Promotions:
Review the Promotions page within your Pinterest Business account for any available credits or promotions. 
Partner Offers:
Look out for potential partner offers or promotions that may be available, as some third-party sites may advertise Pinterest promo codes. 
Billing Credits:
When you run ads, any credits you receive will be applied to your ad spend, reducing your overall cost. 
Accessing Promotions:
Log in to your Pinterest business account.
Navigate to the Billing section under the Business menu.
Select Promotions from the left-hand navigation. 
Note:
Pinterest does not have a general coupon code system like some other platforms. 
If you are looking for discounts or promotions, it's best to check your Billing and Promotions page within your Pinterest Business account.

Pinterest occasionally runs marketing offers that you can apply to your advertiser account. If you're eligible for a credit (a promotional amount that is added to your account to spend on ads) or you applied for a coupon (a discount toward billing), you can see this offer in your account.&

Be mindful that all credits and coupons have an expiration date, after which the offer will no longer apply.

Credits and coupons are automatically applied by Pinterest. If you don't see ones that you expect,  make sure that:

You’re using the account that you’ll be running campaigns in. Credits and coupons are not transferable between accounts.
You’ve successfully paid a bill. Before a credit or coupon can be applied to your account, you need to have a bill that’s been paid and processed. It can take up to two billing cycles before you see the credit in your account.
View your active coupons and credits

You can view your active and expired offers, their terms, validity period and expiration dates on the Promotions page.

Shopify Credits Eligibility

The Shopify Credit is a Pinterest incentive for first time Advertisers. When the Bill is generated, the Credit will be deducted from the Bill, or the Bill total will be subtracted from the Credit balance, depending on which amount is larger.

In order to be eligible for Shopify credits advertisers must:

Have successfully connected your business account to your Shopify account
Accept the Pinterest Business Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
Be new advertisers or have not advertised within the last 90 days
Not have other coupons or credits attached to the advertiser account.
