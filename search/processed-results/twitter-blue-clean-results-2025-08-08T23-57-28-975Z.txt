Abonnement Twitter Blue à 1,80€/an (X Premium)
Partagé par
Elfyr
Hello

Petite technique pour obtenir X Premium (anciennement Twitter Blue) à 1,80€/an


Pour ma part, j'ai suivi cette démarche après avoir vu ce tweet:


1. VPN Indonésie --> Hola VPN par exemple
2. Se connecter sur Twitter
3. S'abonner pour 25.000 IDR + 5.000 IDR (TVA) = 1.80€ environ
4. Payer 

Enjoy!


Il ne faut jamais avoir été abonné dans une autre région auparavant

Edit 30/10 : La méthode a malheureusement été corrigée

Twitter Discount & Shopping FAQs
Does Twitter offer a senior discount?

Does Twitter have a student discount program?

These discounts can range from small percentages off to significant savings, and can apply to a wide variety of goods and services, including software, food, travel, and entertainment. To find student discounts, check the websites of businesses you frequently use, or search online for "student discounts" plus the type of product or service you're looking for.

For more information, please read more about Twitter's student discounts.
Does Twitter offer a birthday discount?
Yes, many companies offer birthday discounts as a way to reward loyal customers and encourage repeat business. These discounts can vary widely in terms of percentage, the types of products or services they apply to, and how they are accessed (e.g., through email, in-app offers, or by showing ID in-store). It's always a good idea to check the specific terms and conditions of the offer before making a purchase to ensure you understand any limitations or restrictions.

These programs often involve earning points or rewards for purchases, which can then be redeemed for discounts, free products, or other perks. Before joining any loyalty program, it's always a good idea to read the terms and conditions carefully to understand how the program works and what benefits you can expect. This will help you make an informed decision about whether or not the program is right for you. This answer was fact-checked on November 21, 2024. For more information, please read more about Twitter's loyalty programs.
Does Twitter sell gift cards?
Yes, many Twitter accounts and businesses utilize Twitter to promote and sell their gift cards. However, Twitter itself does not directly offer gift cards. Always check the terms and conditions of any gift card offer before purchasing. Be aware of scams and only purchase gift cards from reputable sources. This answer was fact-checked on November 21, 2024. For more information, please read more about Twitter's gift cards.
Does Twitter offer free returns?
No, based on the provided data, there is no information about Twitter's return or exchange policy for products or services. To find this information, you should check Twitter's official website for their terms of service and help pages. If you purchased a subscription or product through a third-party app store (like Apple's App Store or Google Play), their return policies would apply. This answer was fact-checked on November 21, 2024.
What payment methods does Twitter accept?
Twitter offers the following payment options as of as of November 21, 2024:


Amazon Pay: Based on the available data, some merchants accept Amazon Pay as a payment method. However, it's crucial to check with the specific merchant before making a purchase to confirm their acceptance of Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay's availability may vary depending on the merchant, location, and other factors. Always review the payment options available at checkout to ensure a smooth transaction.
Apple Pay: Based on the provided data, Twitter itself may not directly process Apple Pay transactions, but many third-party services and businesses integrated with Twitter do accept Apple Pay. Therefore, whether or not you can use Apple Pay depends on the specific service or business you are interacting with on Twitter. For example, you might be able to use Apple Pay to make purchases through certain apps or to tip creators, but not for all Twitter services.
Shop Pay: Based on the provided data, some Twitter users and businesses indicate acceptance of Shop Pay. However, this may not be a universally implemented feature across all Twitter services. It's recommended to check individual seller profiles or contact customer support for confirmation before making a purchase using Shop Pay.
Google Pay: Many Twitter-related services and third-party apps accept Google Pay as a payment method. However, whether or not Twitter itself directly accepts Google Pay for its own services (like subscriptions) is not explicitly stated in the provided data. Always check the specific payment options available at the point of purchase for any Twitter service or product.
What financing methods does Twitter accept?
Twitter offers the following financing options as of as of November 21, 2024:


Klarna financing: Klarna is a buy now, pay later service. It allows you to purchase items and pay for them over time, usually in installments. However, it's crucial to understand that using Klarna involves borrowing money, and late payments can result in fees and negatively impact your credit score. Always review the terms and conditions before using Klarna to ensure you understand the repayment schedule and any associated costs. Not all merchants accept Klarna, so check if your preferred retailer offers this payment option before making a purchase.
Does Twitter have a military discount program?
Twitter might provide military discounts, but we don't have confirmed details at this time. Numerous businesses honor service members with special offers for active duty military, veterans, and their families. For accurate information on Twitter's military discount options and any available Twitter coupon codes, visit their website or contact their support staff directly. This answer was fact-checked on November 21, 2024.
Does Twitter offer a frontline worker discount?
While Twitter might have discounts for frontline workers, we lack definitive information. Many businesses show appreciation for healthcare professionals, first responders, and essential workers through special offers. To find out about any such discounts at Twitter, consult their official channels or customer support team. This answer was fact-checked on November 21, 2024.
