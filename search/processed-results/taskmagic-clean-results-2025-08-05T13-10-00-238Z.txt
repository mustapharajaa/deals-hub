TaskMagic Overview

TaskMagic is a tool that helps you save time by automating boring, repetitive tasks you do on websites. Instead of clicking, typing, or copying and pasting things over and over again, you just step up how the task should be done and the tool will take care of the rest.

It works like a virtual assistant that copies your actions. Unlike Zapier or Make, you don’t need any coding or special app connections. If a human can do the task on a screen, TaskMagic can repeat it. It’s perfect for small tasks, big workflows, or anything in between.

TaskMagic Pricing Plans
Free Forever

With TaskMagic, you can get started at no cost and stay free forever. The free plan has access to unlimited apps, steps, tasks, workflows, and workspaces. It also includes webhooks, filters, math, and delay steps. You can even record clicks, type actions, and scrape websites. And all this comes with 15 hours of cloud runtime.

Apps

The Apps plan is ideal for growing users who need more power. It costs $29 a month and comes with everything in the Free plan and supports unlimited apps, steps, tasks, and workflows. You can also use advanced features like webhooks, filters, math, delays, and scraping.

Apps + Browser

The last plan is priced at $49 a month. It’s best for automation-heavy users. The plan includes everything from the Apps plan, with full browser recording, unlimited steps, tasks, workflows, and advanced features like scraping, filters, and delays. The Apps + Browser plan is designed for serious teams managing multiple workflows across apps and browsers.

TaskMagic Key Features

1. Unlimited Apps & Workflows: With this plan, you can connect as many apps as you want and build unlimited automation workflows. This means you’re not restricted and can automate tasks across different platforms freely.

2. Browser Recording (Clicks & Typing): It can also record your screen while clicking and typing. TaskMagic uses this to repeat your actions automatically, saving you time on repetitive work.

3. Webhooks, Filters & Logic: You can add smart steps like filters, delays, math, and webhooks to control when and how your automations run. It helps make your workflows smarter.

4. Cloud Runtime (15 Hours): Every plan includes 15 hours of cloud time to run your recorded browser tasks online, even when your computer is off.

Wrap Up

TaskMagic is a great tool to have if you want to automate repetitive tasks with little to no effort. It has a free plan you can start with and costs $29 for the first premium plan. You can save money on these plans using our exclusive coupon code!
