DNRater.com is not just a domain appraisal tool; it's an investment guide that accurately reflects the reality of the market. Its valuations are very close to actual market value, which is why I highly recommend it to anyone working in the domain industry.
El Ghazouli Youness
I’ve been using DNRater to get accurate BIN price recommendations for my domain names, and it has been incredibly helpful. Those suggested BINs gave me confidence in pricing. The most impressive result was for **functionaldiagnostics.com**—DNRater recommended a BIN of $4,900, and that guidance helped me negotiate and close a deal at $1,000. The platform is fast, easy to use, and the valuations feel realistic and aligned with market expectations. Compared to other tools I’ve used, DNRater stands out for its practical and trustworthy pricing. I highly recommend it to anyone involved in domain investing.

As a domain investor who uses Dnrater.com daily, I’ve found it incredibly valuable for building a long-term investment portfolio. Dnrater’s AI-powered appraisals are impressively accurate—often much closer to actual sale prices than other tools. This accuracy helps me avoid overbidding at auctions by allowing me to check a domain’s market value in advance and make more informed, safer purchases. Dnrater is a game-changer for serious domain investors focused on sustainable growth.

DnRater is a must-have tool for my domaining business. One of the most important steps before making a decision is checking the DnRater valuation. It’s been working well for me so far—I’ve had multiple four-figure sales and even closed a solid five-figure deal in my latest sale. Thank you, Youness.

I'm really happy to share DNRater.com with you. I have been using this algorithm to pick the right BIN price for my Afternic listings, which leads to generating more sales. I also use it for my purchase decisions. Now you can also try it by using DNRater tool.

When it comes to domain appraisals, my past experiences were quite disappointing. Most tools provided unrealistic values that didn't match the market. However, ever since I started using DNRater.com, I've been amazed by its accuracy. What's even more impressive is how close the selling prices of some of my domains have been to DNRater's estimates. I can confidently say that DNRater.com is a must-have for domain investors.

Tried every other domain appraisal tool, but none ever felt right. A domain name is personal—it’s our baby, our own creation. Too low, it’s offensive. Too high, it’s unrealistic. It has to feel just right. And DnRater nailed it. Our domain Magnetz.com was appraised at $6,700—and sold for $7,000 just a few weeks later! The AI isn’t some half-baked estimate—it genuinely gets it. Huge thanks for building such a solid product!
