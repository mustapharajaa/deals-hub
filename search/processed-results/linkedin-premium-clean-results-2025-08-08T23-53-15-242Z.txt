LinkedIn Premium does not typically offer coupon codes. Instead, they provide free trials and discounts through specific programs and for certain groups. For example, students can access Premium Career at a reduced price, and journalists may receive free Premium access through a LinkedIn program. Additionally, the Microsoft Alumni Network offers a discount on Premium Business subscriptions. 
Here's a breakdown of ways to potentially access LinkedIn Premium at a discount or for free:
Free Trials:
All LinkedIn Premium plans come with a free trial, allowing you to explore the features before committing to a paid subscription. 
Student Discounts:
Students can often get LinkedIn Premium Career at a reduced price, often around $9.99 per month, upon verifying their student status. 
LinkedIn for Journalists Program:
LinkedIn offers Premium access to journalists who meet specific criteria, such as having professional journalism experience and belonging to a relevant organization. 
Microsoft Alumni Network:
Members of this network are eligible for a significant discount on LinkedIn Premium Business subscriptions, potentially for up to 12 months. 
Referral Programs:
Sometimes, existing Premium users can share referral links that offer a discount to their connections. 
Promotional Offers:
LinkedIn periodically runs promotions that offer free or discounted Premium subscriptions. Check the LinkedIn Help page for any current offers. 
To find out about specific discounts or free trials, it's best to check LinkedIn's official website and your profile for any available promotions or to see if you qualify for any of the mentioned programs.

Coupon codes and advertising credits FAQs
Last updated: 3 months ago

Coupon codes can be used to secure advertising credits, which are used to buy LinkedIn advertising products and features, such as single image ads, conversation ads, and boosting a post. Coupon codes are converted to your ad account’s currency once applied.


When you apply a coupon code to your account, advertising charges are first deducted from the coupon value. Your credit card will then be charged once the coupon has been exhausted or has expired.

If you'd prefer your campaign to stay within the dollar amount of the coupon code, you’ll need to set a daily or lifetime budget and end date accordingly.
