There are no specific coupon codes for InDesign itself, but Adobe offers various discounts on Creative Cloud plans that include InDesign. These discounts often apply to the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes InDesign, rather than just individual apps. You can find deals on Adobe's website or through promotional emails. 
Here's a breakdown of how to find discounts and what to expect:
1. Adobe's Special Offers Page:
Adobe frequently features promotions on its "Special Offers" page.
These offers can include discounts on annual plans, bundled apps, and promotions for students and teachers.
For example, you might find a discount on the Creative Cloud all apps plan, which includes InDesign. 
2. Creative Cloud Plans:
InDesign is part of the Creative Cloud suite, so discounts on Creative Cloud plans will apply to InDesign.
You can find various plans, including Photography (Photoshop and Lightroom), Single App (like InDesign), or the All Apps plan.
Look for discounts on these plans, which can be a percentage off or a reduced monthly price for a certain period. 
3. Students and Teachers:
Adobe often provides significant discounts for students and teachers on Creative Cloud plans.
This can be a percentage off the regular price or a special bundled offer. 
4. Other Promotional Codes:
Some third-party websites or publications may offer specific coupon codes for Adobe products. 
However, these are often for limited-time offers and may not be available. 
You can check sites like Coupon.today or HotUKDeals for potential deals. 
5. Redemption Codes:
If you have a redemption code (perhaps from a promotion or a gift card), you'll need to enter it on Adobe's redemption site, according to Adobe.
You can find the redemption site on your insert, card, or email.
Ensure you're on the correct redemption page (for subscriptions or retail products). 
In Summary: While there isn't a direct "InDesign coupon code," look for discounts on Creative Cloud plans that include InDesign. These can be found on the official Adobe website or through promotional emails.

Key Tips for Adobe Shoppers
Adobe’s Cancellation Policy

Since Adobe delivers digital programs through a subscription model, it doesn’t accept returns. However, if you’re buying an annual plan that you’re paying for on a monthly basis, you can get a full refund as long as you cancel within 14 days of the order. After that, Adobe will continue your service for the current month; then, you’ll be charged 50% of the remaining monthly payments as a cancellation fee. More information can be found in their Subscription and Cancelation Terms.

Adobe Customer Support

Adobe offers phone support only for customers with a paid product; to get the current phone number, sign in to your account and scroll down to the “Contact Us” section. In the “Individual” section, click the “sign in to contact us” link. The phone number for your area and product will appear in a pop-up window. If you don’t have a paid product, the best way to get help is through the Adobe Help Center. Click the “Creative Cloud Forums” link in the “Contact Us” section to post a question in the forum. You’ll also find links to the Adobe YouTube channel.
