The TikTok Creator Fund was discontinued in several regions, including the US, UK, France, and Germany, and has been replaced by the Creator Rewards Program. While there are no specific "coupon codes" for the Creator Fund, there are other ways to support creators or access promotional offers on TikTok. These include: 
1. TikTok Creator Marketplace (TCM):
Advertisers can use the code "MEGASALES999" to potentially receive US$999 Ad Credits after completing a creator campaign through the TikTok Creator Marketplace (TCM) with specific criteria, according to eDigital Agency.
This offer is specific to certain regions and requires meeting certain spending and content disclosure requirements, according to eDigital Agency.
The Ad Credits are applied to your TikTok Ads Manager account after meeting the eligibility criteria, according to eDigital Agency. 
2. TikTok Shop Promo Codes:
TikTok Shop offers various promo codes, such as seasonal flash sales, creator partnership codes, free shipping codes, and category-specific discount codes, according to JoinBrands. 
These codes can be found through various channels, including within the TikTok app, on creator content, or through marketing materials, according to JoinBrands. 
Creator partnership codes, for example, can offer discounts of 15-25% on products, according to JoinBrands. 
Redemption methods include entering the code during checkout or through the "My Vouchers" section, according to TikTok. 
3. TikTok Ads Promotional Codes:
TikTok offers promotional codes for advertising campaigns, which can be activated in the TikTok Ads Manager, according to TikTok For Business. 
These codes can be activated by going to the "Finance" section under "Tools" and then clicking "Redeem Coupon", according to TikTok For Business.

More Information for TikTok Shop Customers
TikTok Shop’s Shipping Policy

Shipping terms can vary whether you’re shopping from an individual user or the main TikTok Shop itself. Some items may be tagged with a blue “Free Shipping” label, while others need to meet a shipping minimum. For most items ordered directly from TikTok, the minimum tends to stay pretty low, around a $20 or $30 order value to qualify. For an independent seller, it’ll be up to their own terms.

TikTok Shop’s Return Policy

Return policies are left up to the individual merchants. Make sure to check the store you’re buying from for theirs.

How To Contact TikTok Shop

Because TikTok Shop is a marketplace for individual sellers rather than a single conglomerate, if you need to contact someone, you’ll have to contact that person individually.

About TikTok Shop

TikTok is not just for videos; it’s a global marketplace too! Get connected to all sorts of small businesses, handmade treasures, and the community that makes it all possible. TikTok often even funds promotions and coupons themselves to help bring customers and craftspeople together, benefiting both at the same time. Check CouponFollow for the latest TikTok Shop deals and discounts and treat yourself to something special the next time you’re surfing your special interests.

Want to boost sales and attract new customers on TikTok Shop? This list of six TikTok Shop promo code strategies will help you maximize your budget and drive conversions. Discover how to leverage new user discounts, seasonal flash sales, creator partnerships, free shipping offers, category-specific deals, and loyalty programs. Stop overspending and start saving with these proven TikTok Shop promo code ideas.

1. New User Welcome Discount

For newcomers to TikTok Shop, the platform rolls out the red carpet with an enticing New User Welcome Discount. This TikTok Shop promo code offers a significant percentage off your first purchase, making it a fantastic opportunity to explore the diverse range of products available and experience the seamless in-app shopping experience. This introductory offer is designed to encourage first-time shoppers to engage with the platform and discover the convenience and excitement of social commerce. For DTC and E-commerce brands, this represents a valuable opportunity to capture new customers and cultivate brand loyalty from the outset. Leveraging this promo code effectively can significantly impact your customer acquisition cost and drive early sales momentum.

One of the key advantages of this TikTok Shop promo code is its ease of use. For eligible new users, the discount is often automatically applied at checkout. This removes any friction in the purchasing process and ensures a smooth and positive first impression for potential customers. No need for users to hunt for codes or manually enter them; TikTok Shop streamlines the experience, fostering a sense of instant gratification. For busy social media managers, this automatic application is a time-saver, allowing them to focus on other strategic initiatives.

This welcome discount typically ranges from 10-30% off your first order, depending on current promotions. This substantial saving can significantly influence purchasing decisions, especially for price-sensitive consumers. While the discount percentage is attractive, there’s usually a minimum purchase requirement, often between $25 and $50. This encourages larger initial orders, which is beneficial for brands. For startups and product launch teams, understanding this minimum purchase requirement is crucial for pricing strategies and maximizing the impact of the welcome discount.

The New User Welcome Discount remains valid for 30 days from the date of account creation. This provides a reasonable window of opportunity for new users to browse the platform and find products they want to purchase. However, the expiration date also creates a sense of urgency, encouraging prompt action. For marketers, this limited timeframe can be leveraged to create targeted campaigns that capitalize on the FOMO (fear of missing out) effect, driving conversions within the 30-day window.

A noteworthy advantage of this TikTok Shop promo code is its compatibility with other promotions. Frequently, it can be combined with free shipping offers on qualifying orders, further amplifying the savings and incentivizing purchases. This stacking of promotions is particularly appealing to value-conscious shoppers. For brand managers, understanding these stacking possibilities allows for strategic planning and the creation of compelling bundled offers.

While this TikTok Shop promo code is a powerful acquisition tool, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations. The discount is, by definition, a one-time offer, restricted to new users exclusively. Existing customers won’t be eligible for this particular promotion. This exclusivity underscores the importance of capitalizing on the welcome discount as a first-time shopper. CMOs and Directors of Marketing should view this as a key component of their overall customer acquisition strategy within the TikTok ecosystem.

Compared to other promotional tactics, such as influencer marketing or paid advertising, the New User Welcome Discount provides a more direct and immediate return on investment. It requires no complex setup or ongoing management. Simply create your TikTok Shop account, browse the available products, and enjoy the discount on your first purchase. For software and app developers integrating with TikTok Shop, understanding the mechanics of this welcome discount is essential for a seamless user experience.

In conclusion, the New User Welcome Discount is a highly effective tool for attracting new customers to TikTok Shop. Its ease of use, combined with substantial savings and potential for stacking with other promotions, makes it a must-use for first-time shoppers. For businesses, leveraging this promo code strategically can drive early sales, boost brand awareness, and build a loyal customer base.

2. Seasonal Flash Sale Codes

Savvy shoppers know that timing is everything, and TikTok Shop capitalizes on this with its strategic Seasonal Flash Sale Codes. These limited-time promotional codes are rolled out during peak shopping periods like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, back-to-school season, and other major holidays, creating a frenzy of excitement and deep discounts on trending products. These flash sales offer a unique opportunity for both shoppers and brands to maximize their gains. For shoppers, it’s a chance to snag coveted items at significantly reduced prices. For brands, it’s a powerful way to boost sales, clear inventory, and gain significant visibility within the TikTok ecosystem. These codes are often tied to specific product categories, such as fashion, beauty, or electronics, allowing for targeted promotions that resonate with specific demographics.

What distinguishes these seasonal offers from regular TikTok shop promo codes is the intensity of the discounts and the concentrated timeframe. We’re talking flash discounts of up to 50% off, sometimes even more! Imagine the potential for driving sales and capturing the attention of deal-hungry TikTok users. This sense of urgency, often amplified by countdown timers and limited-quantity deals, is a key driver of engagement and conversion.

Moreover, these seasonal flash sales often leverage the power of creator collaborations. Exclusive codes offered through popular TikTok creators can significantly expand a brand’s reach, tapping into established audiences and leveraging the trust and influence these creators have cultivated. This creates a win-win scenario, benefitting both the brand and the creator.

The benefits for DTC and e-commerce brands, digital marketing agencies, and social media managers are clear. Seasonal flash sales offer a potent tool to drive rapid sales growth, boost brand awareness, and reach new customer segments. Learn more about Seasonal Flash Sale Codes for deeper insights into maximizing these opportunities. Startups, product launch teams, and brand managers can also leverage these codes to generate early buzz and drive initial traction for new product releases. Even established brands can benefit from the renewed interest and increased engagement these sales generate.

For influencer marketing professionals, collaborating with brands on exclusive seasonal flash sale codes provides a compelling value proposition for their followers and strengthens their partnerships with brands. CMOs and Directors of Marketing can integrate these sales into broader marketing campaigns, driving traffic to the TikTok Shop and achieving specific campaign objectives. Software and app developers, as well as SaaS and CPG founders, can also utilize these codes within their respective industries, offering discounts on digital products, subscriptions, or physical goods.

However, the significant advantages of seasonal flash sales also come with some caveats. The biggest downside is the limited availability and short time windows. These flash sales are designed to create a sense of urgency, meaning they disappear quickly. This requires swift decision-making from consumers and meticulous planning from brands. High competition among users is another factor. With deep discounts on popular products, expect a surge in demand, potentially leading to stockouts and disappointed customers. While not predictable or guaranteed, being prepared for these flash sales and understanding the target audience’s preferences can significantly increase the chances of success. There aren’t any specific technical requirements for participating in these sales beyond having an active TikTok Shop and the ability to generate and manage promo codes within the platform. Pricing strategies will depend on the specific products and target profit margins, but the focus is typically on offering significant discounts to drive volume and visibility.

Ultimately, seasonal flash sale codes on TikTok Shop provide a powerful mechanism for boosting sales and engaging with a massive audience. By understanding the dynamics of these sales, brands can leverage the platform’s inherent virality and time-sensitive nature to achieve impressive results. While navigating the competitive landscape and limited timeframes requires strategic planning, the potential rewards make these flash sales a valuable tool for any brand looking to make a splash on TikTok.

3. Creator Partnership Promo Codes

Creator Partnership Promo Codes represent a dynamic intersection of influencer marketing and TikTok Shop, offering a potent strategy for driving sales and building brand awareness. These exclusive discount codes are distributed by TikTok influencers and content creators through their videos, live streams, and bio links, providing a direct pathway from engaging content to product purchase. This approach leverages the trust and connection creators have cultivated with their audience, converting viewership into tangible sales. For brands, it’s a chance to tap into highly engaged niche communities and for creators, it’s an opportunity to monetize their content and deepen relationships with their followers.

The mechanics of these promo codes are straightforward. They function much like traditional coupon codes, but with the added layer of influencer endorsement. Typically, creators will showcase a product in their content, highlight its benefits, and then provide a unique, influencer-specific TikTok shop promo code for their viewers to use at checkout. These codes generally offer a discount ranging from 15-25% on featured products, incentivizing viewers to make a purchase. This method fosters a sense of exclusivity and urgency, as the codes may be time-limited or have usage restrictions.

One of the key advantages of Creator Partnership Promo Codes is the access they provide to creator-curated product collections. This allows brands to present their products within a carefully crafted context, aligning them with the creator’s personal brand and aesthetic. This curated approach often includes behind-the-scenes content and product reviews, offering a more authentic and engaging shopping experience. The direct link integration from TikTok videos streamlines the purchase process, minimizing friction between content consumption and product acquisition. This seamless transition from video to checkout is crucial for capitalizing on viewer interest and maximizing conversion rates.

For DTC and e-commerce brands, leveraging Creator Partnership Promo Codes offers a targeted approach to reach specific demographics. By partnering with creators whose audience aligns with their target market, brands can ensure their message resonates with potential customers. Digital marketing and advertising agencies can integrate these promo codes into broader campaign strategies, amplifying their reach and impact. In-house social media managers can utilize these codes to boost engagement and drive traffic to the brand’s TikTok Shop. For startups and product launch teams, this can be an invaluable tool for generating early buzz and driving initial sales. Learn more about Creator Partnership Promo Codes and gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage them effectively.

While the benefits are numerous, there are some potential drawbacks to consider. The reach of Creator Partnership Promo Codes is inherently limited to the specific creator’s audience. While this allows for targeted marketing, it also means that brands may need to partner with multiple creators to achieve broader reach. Additionally, there may be usage limits per code, which can restrict the overall impact of the promotion. The product selection is naturally restricted to the creator partnerships that a brand establishes, which requires careful consideration of product-influencer fit. Finally, codes may expire without notice, creating potential frustration for consumers who miss the opportunity.

Despite these limitations, Creator Partnership Promo Codes remain a valuable tool for leveraging the power of influencer marketing on TikTok Shop. They provide a direct and engaging way to connect with potential customers, drive sales, and build brand awareness within targeted communities. By understanding the features, benefits, and potential drawbacks, brands and creators alike can effectively utilize this strategy to achieve their respective marketing goals. Visit the official TikTok Shop to explore how these promo codes are integrated into the platform. For businesses exploring this avenue, consider factors like audience alignment, creator authenticity, and campaign objectives to maximize the effectiveness of your TikTok shop promo code strategy. Remember, the key is to forge genuine partnerships that resonate with both the creator’s audience and your brand values.

4. Free Shipping Promotional Codes

Free shipping is a powerful incentive in online shopping, and TikTok Shop understands this well. Free shipping promotional codes are a key tool for driving sales and fostering customer loyalty on the platform. These dedicated promo codes eliminate shipping costs, making purchases more attractive, especially for items with higher shipping fees, such as those requiring international shipping or expedited delivery. TikTok regularly distributes these codes to encourage larger order volumes and repeat business, making them a valuable asset for both buyers and sellers. This strategy benefits both the consumer, who enjoys cost savings, and the merchant, who can see increased average order values and customer retention.

For DTC and e-commerce brands, free shipping promotions can be a game-changer. Imagine a customer adding several items to their cart, only to abandon it at checkout due to high shipping costs. A free shipping promo code can be the deciding factor that pushes them to complete the purchase. This is particularly true for international customers, where shipping costs can be prohibitive. For brands working with influencer marketing professionals, incorporating free shipping promo codes into influencer campaigns can significantly boost conversion rates. By providing influencers with unique codes to share with their followers, brands can track campaign performance and attribute sales directly to the influencer’s efforts.

Free shipping codes on TikTok Shop often come with a minimum order value, typically ranging from $35 to $75. This encourages customers to add more items to their cart to reach the threshold, effectively increasing the average order value for businesses. While the specific minimum order value might vary based on the promotion and the seller, this requirement is a common practice across most e-commerce platforms utilizing free shipping offers. This strategy allows businesses to offset the cost of shipping while still offering a compelling incentive to consumers.

One of the major advantages of TikTok Shop’s free shipping promo codes is their compatibility with other percentage-off discounts. This “stacking” capability allows customers to maximize their savings, making purchases even more appealing. For example, a customer could use a 10% off code in conjunction with a free shipping code, effectively getting a double discount. This flexibility makes TikTok Shop’s promotional system particularly attractive for savvy shoppers. For marketing managers and CMOs, understanding these stacking possibilities is crucial for crafting effective promotional strategies and maximizing ROI.

While free shipping promotions offer numerous benefits, they also have some limitations. The time-limited validity of these codes creates a sense of urgency, encouraging customers to act quickly, but it also means they might miss out if they aren’t aware of the promotion in time. Furthermore, free shipping may not always cover expedited shipping fully, or may be limited to specific product categories. Software and app developers working with the TikTok Shop API should account for these nuances when integrating promotional features into their applications. Ensuring that these limitations are clearly communicated to the end-user is crucial for maintaining transparency and a positive customer experience.

Compared to other platforms that offer free shipping promotions intermittently or as part of premium memberships, TikTok Shop offers them regularly throughout the year. This consistency makes it a more attractive platform for both buyers and sellers. For startups and product launch teams, regular access to free shipping promotions can be a valuable tool for attracting early adopters and building momentum.

Setting up and implementing free shipping promotions within TikTok Shop is relatively straightforward. Sellers can create and manage promotional codes directly through the TikTok Shop Seller Center. They can specify the duration of the promotion, the minimum order value, and any other relevant restrictions. This centralized management system makes it easy for businesses to track the performance of their promotional campaigns and make data-driven decisions.

In conclusion, free shipping promotional codes on TikTok Shop are a powerful tool for boosting sales, increasing average order value, and fostering customer loyalty. Link to TikTok Shop: https://shop.tiktok.com While there are limitations to be aware of, the regular availability and flexibility of these promotions make them a valuable asset for businesses of all sizes operating on the platform. From SaaS founders looking to drive conversions to CPG founders aiming to expand their reach, leveraging free shipping promo codes can be a key element of a successful TikTok Shop strategy.

5. Category-Specific Discount Codes

Unlocking deeper discounts on TikTok Shop often involves leveraging category-specific promo codes. These targeted TikTok shop promo codes are designed for particular product categories, such as fashion, beauty, home goods, electronics, and health products. This strategic approach allows brands to boost sales in specific segments, introduce users to new product lines, and offer more appealing discounts to niche audiences. This type of promotion is particularly effective for enticing new customers and clearing out inventory within a specific product category. For savvy shoppers, these codes offer a chance to snag higher discounts on items they already plan to purchase.

For DTC and e-commerce brands, category-specific TikTok shop promo codes are a powerful tool for driving targeted traffic and conversions. Imagine you’re launching a new line of skincare products. A category-specific promo code exclusively for “beauty” products can incentivize TikTok users to try your new offerings. Similarly, established brands can use these codes to clear out seasonal inventory or promote slow-moving products within a particular category. This targeted approach maximizes your marketing spend by reaching consumers who are already interested in the specific product category.

These category-focused discounts typically range from 20-40% off, making them significantly more attractive than general sitewide promotions. The rotating weekly focus on different product types keeps the offers fresh and encourages repeat visits to the TikTok Shop. For example, one week might feature discounts on “fashion,” while the next week could highlight “electronics.” This dynamic approach creates a sense of urgency and encourages impulse purchases. Additionally, some brands offer bulk purchase incentives for consumable goods within a specific category, further driving sales volume. For new product launches, exclusive access codes within a category can generate buzz and early adoption. Seasonal category promotions, like discounts on winter apparel during the holiday season, also capitalize on timely shopping trends.

While the benefits are significant, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks. The primary limitation is that these TikTok shop promo codes are restricted to specific product types. This means a code for “fashion” won’t apply to items in the “electronics” category. This specificity can be frustrating for shoppers whose immediate needs fall outside the currently promoted category. Furthermore, discount percentages can vary by category, and some categories may be excluded from promotions altogether.

Implementing category-specific discount codes is straightforward within the TikTok Shop platform (https://shop.tiktok.com). Brands can create unique codes for each category and schedule their release based on marketing objectives. There are no specific technical requirements beyond a standard TikTok Shop account. Compared to other promotional tools like influencer marketing or paid advertising, category-specific discounts offer a more direct and cost-effective way to drive sales within targeted niches.

Implementation Tips for Success:

Strategic Timing: Align category promotions with seasonal trends and product launch cycles.
Clear Communication: Clearly highlight the eligible categories and discount percentages in your promotional materials.
Cross-Promotion: Promote the codes across your other social media channels and email marketing campaigns to maximize reach.
Data Analysis: Track the performance of each category-specific campaign to optimize future promotions.

By understanding the nuances of category-specific TikTok shop promo codes, brands can leverage this powerful tool to drive targeted traffic, increase sales, and engage with their audience on a deeper level. For consumers, these codes unlock exclusive discounts and provide a curated shopping experience tailored to their specific interests.

6. Loyalty Rewards Program Codes

TikTok Shop’s loyalty rewards program offers a compelling way to incentivize repeat purchases and cultivate a dedicated customer base. By rewarding shoppers with exclusive TikTok shop promo codes, brands can foster long-term relationships and boost sales within the platform. This strategy moves beyond one-time purchases and encourages customers to integrate your brand into their regular shopping habits. This is particularly valuable in the competitive landscape of TikTok, where capturing and retaining attention is paramount. For DTC and e-commerce brands, social media managers, and marketing professionals seeking sustainable growth on TikTok, leveraging these loyalty program codes is a strategic imperative.

The program operates on a points-based system, typically awarding 1 point for every $1 spent. As customers accumulate points, they ascend through tiered membership levels, unlocking increasingly attractive benefits. This gamified approach not only rewards consistent shopping behavior but also motivates users to strive for higher tiers and their associated perks. Think of it as a VIP club within your TikTok Shop, creating a sense of exclusivity and community among your most loyal customers.

One of the significant advantages of this system is its cumulative nature. The longer a customer engages with your brand, the more substantial the rewards become. This fosters a positive feedback loop, encouraging repeat purchases and deepening customer loyalty. Beyond standard discounts, loyalty members can enjoy birthday and anniversary special codes, early access to sales and new products, and even referral bonus codes for bringing new users into the fold. This multifaceted approach ensures that the rewards remain engaging and relevant throughout the customer lifecycle. For example, a tiered system might offer free shipping at the first level, a percentage discount at the second, and early access to exclusive products at the third. This tiered structure encourages continued engagement and provides clear goals for shoppers.

While the benefits of a loyalty program are undeniable, there are some considerations to keep in mind. For new customers, the initial value proposition might seem limited, as significant benefits are locked behind spending thresholds. This means it takes time and consistent purchases to unlock the most attractive rewards. Additionally, point expiration policies might apply, adding a sense of urgency but also potentially frustrating customers who haven’t accumulated enough points within a given timeframe. Furthermore, the program’s effectiveness hinges on the perceived value of the rewards. If the discounts or perks are not compelling enough, customers may not be motivated to participate.

Despite these potential drawbacks, the long-term benefits of a well-structured loyalty program can significantly outweigh the initial setup and management efforts. By understanding the nuances of TikTok Shop’s loyalty program, brands can tailor their strategies to maximize customer engagement and drive sustainable growth.

This can be especially beneficial for startups, product launch teams, and brand managers looking to establish a strong customer base.

While specific pricing or technical requirements for setting up the loyalty program within TikTok Shop are not readily available publicly, it’s likely integrated into the merchant platform. Brands should explore the TikTok Shop merchant resources and documentation or contact TikTok Shop support for detailed information on implementation and customization options. Compared to other promotional tactics like one-time discounts or influencer marketing campaigns, the loyalty program offers a more sustainable and predictable approach to customer retention, making it a worthwhile investment for long-term success on the platform. It’s crucial for CMOs, Directors of Marketing, and even Software and app developers working with DTC brands to understand how this feature can be integrated into their overall marketing strategy. By rewarding loyal customers, brands build a community of advocates who contribute not only to sales but also to brand visibility and organic reach within the TikTok ecosystem.
